When creating XAML or other UI controls/elements NEVER specify in the element itself the font/style information. Do not use classes either unless absolutely necessary. Omit font/colors entirely so the implicit defaults from the theme will always be used.

=== PATH SANDBOXING & SECURITY MODEL ===
Instructions MUST use relative paths with placeholders: <<modDirectory>>\filename*.zip or <<kotorDirectory>>/Override
- ALL instruction Source/Destination fields MUST START with <<modDirectory>> or <<kotorDirectory>>
- This prevents malicious TOML files from targeting system directories (C:\Windows, etc.)
- Internal code can make paths absolute as needed, but instruction definitions must use placeholders

=== PATH RESOLUTION PIPELINE ===
- Replaces <<modDirectory>>/<<kotorDirectory>> with actual paths at install time or dry-run time.
- Require all Actions (except for Choose) to be defined with the prefixes <<modDirectory>> or <<kotorDirectory>>. NO absolute paths are allowed.
- EnumerateFilesWithWildcards() - Resolves wildcards (*, ?) to actual file paths using the file system provider (either VirtualFileSystemProvider or RealFileSystemProvider based on whether an install is happening)
- SetRealPaths() - Used during dry-run/real installs to resolve <<modDirectory>>

=== VIRTUAL FILE SYSTEM (CRITICAL) ===
- VirtualFileSystemProvider tracks files as they're created/moved/deleted/renamed during instruction execution
- Used for dry-run validation and download analysis to predict file state at each instruction
- MUST be initialized with InitializeFromRealFileSystemAsync() to load existing files from disk first
- As instructions execute, VFS updates: Extract adds files, Move relocates them, Delete removes them
- NEVER use RealFileSystemProvider for validation/analysis - only VirtualFileSystemProvider
- See ExecuteInstructionsAsync for the instruction execution flow that updates VFS state

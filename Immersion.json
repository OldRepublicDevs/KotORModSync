    "Description": "BioWare did a few wacky things with character progression in this game. To an extent that's novel, since it helps make companions feel more unique. But it becomes less novel when you realize that most of what they did is just make Jedi companions super OP and short most other party members on stats & feats they should have had.\r\n\r\nAs part of the Thematic series of mods by JC and myself, Thematic KOTOR Companions is a rework of companion starting attributes, skills, feats and powers to lock all companions into having the exact amount of bonuses they should for their level, as well as re-tuning several of their setups to more closely match the characters' behaviors and backstories. The goal is to ensure that companions' statlines are not only thematically consistent, but also broadly mechanically balanced, to better-incentivize the use of under-utilized party members.",

You will be prompted to overwrite, and this is normal. Do NOT move any of the files in the main mod folder! Your install is done once you've moved your desired textures from the main mod download.",

I felt that visually differentiating them a bit would make Bandon seem more unique by comparison, and thus this mod.",

This mod makes the clothing of each rank clear and consistent, with an established breakdown of epaulettes, as well as rank and regiment insignias. New, and thanks to Sith Holocron, these textures have also been further enhanced and upscaled to match the rest of the vanilla game's upscales present in the mod builds.",

    "Description": "Rather than a supplementary, this mod by olegkuz should be treated as an alternative to HD Fire and Ice & Hi-Res Beam Effects, already listed above. While this mod edits some files they don't touch and vice-versa, for the most part it replaces those textures. If you would like, you can install this mod and simply not overwrite when prompted to keep most of the changes of Fire and Ice HD & Hi-Res Beam Effects while only adding the files from this mod that those mods don't touch, but if you choose to overwrite this mod will be your main graphical edit for FX.\r\n\r\nI'm also looking for opinions about this and whether users prefer it to Fire and Ice HD & HR Beam Effects, so please feel free to drop by the [Discord](https://discord.gg/kotor) and let me know what you think!",

    "Description": "With this mod, Crazy has added *dynamic reflections* to each and every lightsaber across every area of the game. When you're fighting a Dark Jedi, you're going to see your faces bathed in shifting colors, fading and brightening as you swing your lightsabers; when you ignite your saber in a hallway, it will reflect on the floor and walls, and will realistically increase in intensity as the blade draws nearer to the surface. This is an incredible project, and easily one of the most important—and impressive—mods ever released for KOTOR.",

This mod restores two upgrades to the game: one that reduces the speed loss taken when hitting an obstacle, and one which increases acceleration. Right now this mod isn't a perfect implementation of what I'd like, including too few upgrades which are a bit pricey relative to the benefit they give, but I still think it's better for players to have the option to use them than not.",

    "Description": "As you know, KOTOR has a binary ending: Light Side or Dark Side. But it wasn't always so—until quite late in development a very unique ending for Dark Side players who romanced Carth was still being developed, and voice lines were even recorded for it. For unknown reasons this ending was cut, but with this mod it has now been restored. You are not locked into this alternate ending, it's only presented as an option which your character may choose. More than this can't be said without giving the ending away, but do note that unless you intend to play as a DS character capable of romancing Carth, this mod will not make any visible changes. Please also note, a third-party mod by Leilukin not present in this guide makes Carth able to be romanced by male characters, and is compatible with both the mod builds and this mod specifically.",

    "Description": "2003 was a different time, but this mod *really* proves that. In vanilla, if you request a 'massage' from some slaves—which has some sexual implications in Star Wars—you get nothing more than a disgusted remark from some companions. You can even threaten them without consequence. This mod properly amends this, giving you two options: for those deeply bothered by the ability to take advantage of the slaves the option to pressure them into servicing you can be removed entirely, whereas the second retains the massage, but gives Dark Side points for requesting it, as well as adding DS points for threatening the slaves at any point.",

    "Description": "It's difficult for me to talk about this mod without gushing about it. In my opinion, this mod is the *best* piece of added quest content ever made for either KOTOR or KOTOR 2: best-written, best-structured, best-balanced, best-voiced, and most sensible. It brings the player's past into the equation without mandating anything about their nature, and provides a real and immersive look at what your character's past was, and future could be, all while being lore-friendly to **BOTH** KOTOR 2 and The Old Republic. The only reason this mod isn't marked as Essential is because it reuses one module in a way which doesn't allow for suspension of disbelief—everything else about this mod is perfect.",

    "Description": "This is a meaty mod that makes a lot of changes, and I strongly recommend reading the mod description in detail, but here is a brief synopsis: in KOTOR, repeating rifles (think machine guns) were supposed to be able to make multiple attacks per turn, but this was cut. This mod adds multifire (+1 attack per round) to all *rifles*, and autofire (+2 attacks per round) to *repeaters*, along with an attack (chance-to-hit) penalty to both weapon types, of -4 and -6 respectively. There are two important caveats to this: the rifles change was not something that was originally intended by BioWare (but which I don't find terribly unbalanced, because it helps enemies too); and the multifire and autofire *are not toggles*, they are always on for those weapon types. The mod does have several install options which do not add the multifire to rifles, however, if you don't want the change which BioWare did not intend.\r\n\r\nIf you would prefer a pure damage increase to resolve the discrepancy in repeating rifle price/rarity rather than this multifire option, you can skip this mod and install JC's Blaster Adjustment below. JC's Blaster Adjustment can also be used in conjunction with any install option of Multifire and Autofire.",
    "DescriptionSpoilerFree": "",
    "InstallationMethod": "TSLPatcher",
    "Directions": "Run the patcher and select your desired install. I personally would recommend using at least one of the first three, as the mod is not worth it for just the feat changes in my opinion. My personal recommendation would be option 2 or 3 (especially if intending to use JC's Blaster Adjustment below), but I tested it with option 1 and did not find it terribly overpowered. Indeed, it made the game way harder at points as enemies were beaming me with multiple rifle attacks, so if you want an extra challenge option 1 is a valid choice.",

    "Description": "Although this mod was made as a standalone option to resolve multiple problems with blasters - low blaster base damage, minimal crit chance variety, and weaker repeaters than BioWare intended - it can also be used in conjunction with bdaman's mod above. Long story short, JC's mod takes KOTOR's blasters and (for the most part) gives them the stats of KOTOR 2's blasters, including their more varied critical chances and bonus damage. This takes a weapon type which is extremely limited in its potential in the original game and leaves them viable for players.",

    "Directions": "If you installed the main option of Multifire and Autofire, I recommend using the *Blaster Pistol + Critical* option of this mod, as applying its changes to repeaters and rifles would make them insanely overpowered with their auto-attacks. If using Options 2 or 3 of Multifire and Autofire, I would recommend the *Blaster Pistol & Blaster Rifle + Critical* version of this mod--don't worry, it won't make rifles way stronger; JC's changes to the damage will overwrite bdaman's, in effect just adding JC's alterations to the critical strike ranges. Finally, if not using bdaman's mod, I recommend the full install.",

Why is it that, as a paragon of the Light, the strength of your connections changes nothing about the power of the Force you can use to defend yourself? Well, now it does. Be an enlightened Jedi with mighty buffs that last an extended duration, or a fierce Sith Lord whose lightnings are easy to cast and mercilessly damaging. But better still, this mod isn't about a power fantasy—there are consequences that come from aligning strongly with one side, leading to atrophied abilities from the other extreme. It's a well-thought-out design that is well-balanced and feels great ingame while also being logically consistent. In my view, that makes this mod a must-have.",

    "Description": "This is a script written by Flachzangen which allows you to remove duplicate .TGA or .TPC files in your game directory. Files with the .TPC filetype take priority, so for several of the patches we've downloaded which are of the .tga filetype, we need to delete any .TPC duplicates in order to get them to read properly. That's what this script will do.\r\n\r\n:::warning\r\nNote\r\n:   It is **CRITICAL** to use this script, as, if .tpc files take priority in some instances, the game will crash.\r\n:::",

    "InstallationMethod": ".bat Patcher",
    "Directions": "Place DelDuplicateTGA-TPC (or the bash script version) in your main game folder (NOT override!), run it, **say that TPC should be deleted** and do not manually confirm. If you are on a Mac or other device that cannot run .bat files and the bash script is not an option for you to use, a list of all the files you will need to manually delete can be found [here](/modding/mod_builds/k1/delete).\r\n\r\n    **MAKE SURE THIS SCRIPT RUNS PROPERLY!** On some operating systems, overzealous antivirus setups, or filepaths with particular characters in them it may fail. If the file outputs \"Finished, Press any key to continue\" but does not list any files it deleted, it *is not working*, and if it does not work it *will* crash your game. You can try to resolve this by moving your Override folder to a different location (I recommend a subfolder in your Documents or Downloads directories), putting the .bat file there and running it through that directory, but if that doesn't work you will need to manually go through and delete the duplicates from the link above.",

Additionally delete N_CommM01 - 06, plus N_CommM08, if using Dark Hope's male clothing upscale. Only then move the files to your override), and then all remaining content that matches content you chose to use from the builds (again, skipping Better Twi'lek Male Heads, if using Leilukin's mod). I also recommend against using the patch for JC's Mandalorian Armor, as there are better options (in my opinion) in Character Textures & Model Fixes below. If using Thigh-High Boots for Twi'lek, only move the patch content from the NPC Replacement folder. If using Republic Soldier's New Shade, use the New Shade option.",

    "Description": "This mod is an upscale of virtually all NPC textures in the game, including aliens and some creatures. But that's not all—Rob is skilled with texture work, and although this package uses AI as a base, he's gone over it by hand and corrected, adjusted, and in some cases entirely retextured parts of the textures to eliminate hallucinations, burring or fuzziness, and preserve the original aesthetic of the texture. What's more, Rob's forte is modeling, and he's included a huge series of model adjustments and fixes along with this package which fixes various rendering issues. I can't recommend this package highly enough.",

    "InstallationMethod": "Loose-File (with optional automation)",
    "Directions": "If you are on a system which can run .bat files, I *strongly* recommend using the automated system to deal with compatibility for this mod. To do so, first extract redrob's mod from its archive, then go to [this page](https://github.com/KOTOR-Community-Portal/mod-builds/blob/main/scripts/cleaner.bat) and click on the button with the arrow pointing down at the top of the code list (the one which says \"download raw file\"). Place cleaner.bat in the folder from redrob's mod called \"Copy contents to KotOR's Override folder\", then go to [here](https://github.com/KOTOR-Community-Portal/mod-builds/blob/main/scripts/cleanlist_k1.txt) and repeat the same step, placing cleanlist_k1.txt in the same location. You can now run cleanlist.bat: follow the instructions onscreen, selecting whether you did or didn't use any of the given mods, and the batch file will automatically delete the incompatible files. Once you reach the end of the list, you can exit the .bat window, delete cleaner.bat and cleanlist_k1.txt, and then move the remaining files in the folder to your override.\r\n\r\n    If you cannot run .bat files or feel uncomfortable running this file, you will need to manually delete the files yourself, following the instructions [here](https://github.com/KOTOR-Community-Portal/mod-builds/blob/main/content/k1/redrob_deletions.md).",

    "Description": "This is a program which modifies your game's executable file to be able to utilize up to 4 gigabytes of RAM, since KOTOR is a 32-bit application and by default can only utilize 2 gigabytes. This will help the game run smoothly even with the larger texture throughput this build creates, and also reduces issues caused by a memory leak which is native to the game, preventing crashes and savegame corruption.",

Once you are done applying all your chosen widescreen content, you are then free to apply this patch.\r\n\r\n    Additionally, **DO NOT** apply this step with the Steam version of the game, unless you have applied the below widescreen patch! Without the modified widescreen .exe, Steam's executable copy is encrypted in such a way that executing this patcher will break it and prevent the game from launching. Although it's unfortunate to not have access to the patch, it doesn't introduce any fatal errors or shortcomings if you are on Steam and choose not to apply widescreen so it can be used; I recommend just being sure to exit your game and restart the application from the top once every four hours or so!",
